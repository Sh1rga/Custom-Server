---   Sh1rga Chat Custom Server   ---
You can run a server that is not an official Sh1rga server.
This is useful if you cannot connect to Sh1rga's servers or if you do not trust Sh1rga.


= Setup =
1.  node.js is required. Please install it.
2.  Run server.js in node.js. The server will run on port 6336.
3.  Please use nginx or similar to make "http://localhost:6336" accessible on the Internet.
4.  Enter the server address in the Sh1rga Chat.
(If you want to let people know that the server is temporarily out of service, you can run serverstop.js)
